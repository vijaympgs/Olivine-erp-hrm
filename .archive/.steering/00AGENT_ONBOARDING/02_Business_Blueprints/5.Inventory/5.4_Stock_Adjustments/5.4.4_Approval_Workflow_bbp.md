# 5.4.4 Adjustment Approval Workflow
Template Ref: _rule_01 (Governance Rule)

## 5.4.4.1 Business Purpose

Defines the logic for routing **Stock Adjustments** to managers for authorization. This prevent unauthorized stock write-offs and ensures high-value corrections are reviewed.

## 5.4.4.2 Logic & Rules

### A) Threshold-based Approval
- IF `adjustment_value` > `$500` -> Route to **Store Manager**.
- IF `adjustment_value` > `$5000` -> Route to **Regional Manager**.

### B) Reason-code based Approval
- All "Damage" or "Theft" reason codes require approval regardless of value.
