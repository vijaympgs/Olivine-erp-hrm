# 5.5.5 Reconciliation (Post-Count Posting)
Template Ref: _txn_02 (Medium Transaction)

## 5.5.5.1 Business Purpose

The **Reconciliation** module is the final step of a physical inventory cycle. It automatically generates the required **Stock Adjustments** to align system quantity with the physically counted quantity once the count has been approved.

**Goals**:
-   **Execution**: Automated posting of variances.
-   **Audit Trail**: Links the resulting Adjustment documents back to the source Stock Take.
